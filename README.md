Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: 
Its a branch of computer science that deals with design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Software engineering is a discipline that combines elements of computer science, Information technology, and discrete mathematics to design, develop,test and maintain software systems. Software engineering focuses on creating solutions for computers.The software engineering process is characterised by its emphasis on quality, adaptability, and the integration of new and untested elements into software projects. This is different from traditional programming, which is more focused on writing code for specific applications and often follows a more rigid, linear approach to development.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Key phases in SDLC include:
1. Requirement gathering- The initial phase involves understanding the clients needs and defining the projects objectives. It involves coming up with a BRD(business requiremnet documents that summarises the whole project expectation)
2. System design- Based on the requirements gathered, the system architecture and designs are created. Architecture is drawn using tools like LucidChart. Designs are created using figma.Designs are usually the system's UI unlike the architecture which details the whole flow of the system(Both backend and frontend)
3. Implementation-Its the coding phase where the designs and the architecture are converted into code ensuring that the expectation is accurately implemented. 
4. Integration and Testing- Done after coding. The software components are integrated into a complete system and extensive testing done. Testing ensures that the software meets all specified requirements and is free of bugs.
5. Deployment-Done once the software is tested and considered ready for production. Here the system becomes accessible to the end-users. Initial deployment can be done to a specified group to ensure that the system undergoes stress-testing before full rollout to everyone.
6. Maintenance-Happens after deployment. Here updates are made, repairs, and further enhancements based on the user feedbacks and evolving requirements.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile vs Waterfall Models - Agile: Its an iterative, incremental, and adaptive approach to software development. Agile teams work in short sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks, and focus on delivering small, usable pieces of software at the end of each sprint. Agile methodologies prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction, making them well-suited for projects with changing requirements and uncertainty.
Waterfall: Traditional and linear approach to software development.In this model, development is divided into distinct phases such as requirement gathering, design, development, testing and deployment. Each phase must be completed before the next one can begin.Its often used in projects where the requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change. 
The choice between Agile and Waterfall depends on the projects' nature, the level of requiremnets certainty, and the desired speed of delivery. Agile offers flexibility and rapid iterations, ideal for projects with evolving requiremnts while waterfall provides clear, predicatble path from start to finish, suitable for projects with stable, well-defined requirements.
 
Requirements Engineering:
Its a phase of SDLC that focuses on the identification, analysis, documentation and validation of software requirements.Its important in that it ensure the developed software aligns with the needs and expectations of its users.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design refers to the practice of structuring a program into separate sub-modules, each performing a specific function.This approach breaks down complex software systems into smaller, more manageable components, making the software easier to understand, develop, test, and maintain.
1. Improving maintainability : 
-Isolation of Changes: When a change is made in one module, it typically does not impact other modules. This isolation makes it easier to identify and fix bugs without affecting the rest of the system, thus improving maintainability.
-Easier Debugging and Testing: Since modules are relatively independent, debugging and testing efforts can be focused on specific areas, making the process more efficient.
-Code Organization and Readability: Modularity enhances code organization and readability by dividing a complex system into smaller, logically structured modules. This simplification aids in understanding and navigating the codebase.
2. Improving Scalability: 
-Flexible Expansion: Modular systems can be scaled more readily by adding new modules or enhancing existing ones without significantly impacting the rest of the system. This flexibility is crucial for adapting to growth or changes in requirements.
-Parallel Development: Different teams can work on different modules simultaneously, decreasing development time and allowing for faster scaling of the system 
-Reuse of Proven Code: Modules designed for one project can often be reused in another, saving development time and reducing errors by leveraging proven code

Testing in Software Engineering: Testing is a critical phase in software engineering that ensures the software functions correctly and meets its intended purposes.It involves executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs.
Effective testing strategies include: 
1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of the software to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
Integration Testing: Combining individual units and testing them as a group to determine if they function together correctly.
2. System Testing: Testing the entire system to evaluate its compliance with the specified requirements.
3. Acceptance Testing: Testing conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria and to enable the customer to determine whether to accept the system.
4. Effective testing, facilitated by the modularity of software design, helps in identifying and fixing issues early, ensuring the reliability and quality of the software product.
